This program is used for brute forcing the password on an httpauth web application.
A few modifications could weaponize this into accepting filenames for usernames, passwords, and urls.
IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO ASK FOR THE MODIFIED CODE, DONT!
Quit being a script kiddie.

PASSWORD FOUND:
root@kali:~/scripts/PythonScripts# python3 httpauth.py
