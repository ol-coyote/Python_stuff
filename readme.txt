V1 release notes:
First commit is mostly working, pushed to create baseline. Will open a text file containing IP address
on each line. The users file hasn't been implemented yet. I also plan on threading the application to 
speed up the scan process time. Most of the network related errors have been handled and tested at this time.

TODO:
Thread 
Implement user name list for known user names to scan on connect
Implement port changing ability currently hard coded to connect on port 25.
